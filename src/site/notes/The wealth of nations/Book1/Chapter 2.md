In Chapter II of _The Wealth of Nations_, Adam Smith discusses the fundamental cause behind the division of labour. Smith argues that this division, which significantly increases productivity and economic prosperity, is not a result of intentional human planning but rather a natural consequence of human beings’ innate tendency to trade, barter, and exchange goods. Unlike animals, humans rely heavily on one another for meeting their diverse needs, but cannot solely depend on others’ goodwill or generosity. Instead, they must appeal to each other’s self-interest through mutual exchange, which leads individuals to specialize in particular occupations. As people specialize, they become more skilled, creating greater efficiency, productivity, and ultimately, prosperity within society. Smith further emphasizes that differences in talent among individuals are less innate and more the result of education, habit, and specialization itself. By contrast, animals, despite sometimes possessing distinct abilities, do not trade or benefit collectively from their talents, remaining individually independent and isolated.

  

### **Author’s Main Ideas:**

1. **Division of Labour Originates from Exchange**:
    
    The division of labour emerges naturally from humans’ inherent propensity(倾向) to trade goods and services.
    
2. **Necessity of Self-interest in Economic Transactions**:
    
    People engage in trade not primarily out of kindness, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">out of self-interest</mark>. It is this mutual self-interest that motivates cooperation and exchanges.
    
3. **Interdependence Among Humans**:
    
    Humans constantly need assistance from others, unlike animals which are naturally independent upon reaching maturity. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This interdependence fosters trade and specialization</mark>.
    
4. **Specialization Enhances Productivity**:
    
    By concentrating on one specific task or occupation, individuals increase their skill, efficiency, and productivity, benefiting society as a whole.
    
5. **Differences in Talent Result from Specialization, Not Innate(adj.天生的) Ability**:
    
    Most differences in skills and abilities among people result from education, habit, and practice in specific tasks rather than inherent natural differences.
    
6. **Human Society Benefits from Diverse Talents through Exchange**:
    
    Unlike animals, whose differing abilities do not benefit one another, humans’ diverse talents, when combined through exchange, contribute significantly to collective welfare.


### 个人总结

分工是人类的自然行为。它来源于人们对商品和服务的交易需求，根据亚当斯密的理论，这都来源于人类最根本特性：利己性。由于这一特性以及人类渴望从他人那里得到商品和服务，加上人类对于不同技能的天赋（有人擅长做手工，有人擅长计算，有人擅长阅读），形成了社会上的专业分工。人类之间的这种分工和交易，促进了社会发展，提高了社会生产力和社会福利。
