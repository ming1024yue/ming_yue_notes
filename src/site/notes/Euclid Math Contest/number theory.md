### Definitions:

- **A perfect square** (or simply *square*) is an integer that is equal to some integer to the second power.  
  Some examples are:  
  $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100$

- **A perfect cube** (or simply *cube*) is an integer that is equal to some integer to the third power.  
  Some examples are:  
  $0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512$

$$
\begin{aligned}
0^3 &= 0 \quad &3^3 &= 27 \quad &6^3 &= 216 \\
1^3 &= 1 \quad &4^3 &= 64 \quad &7^3 &= 343 \\
2^3 &= 8 \quad &5^3 &= 125 \quad &8^3 &= 512 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

- **A perfect power** is an integer that is equal to some integer to a power that is at least 2.  
  Perfect squares and perfect cubes are examples of perfect powers.  
  Some others are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2^5 &= 32 \\
3^4 &= 81 \\
6^4 &= 1296 \\
5^6 &= 15625 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
**Definition:**  
We say that an integer $m$ is **divisible** by an integer $n$ when the quotient $\dfrac{m}{n}$ is an integer.

Otherwise, we say that $m$ is *not divisible* by $n$.

**Divisor**
When we say, “12 is a multiple of 3,” we mean that there is an integer that we can multiply by 3 that results in a product of 12.  Since 12 is divisible by 3, we call 3 a **divisor** of 12.

> *"If $b$ is divisible by $a$ and $c$ is divisible by $b$, then $c$ is divisible by $a$."*

We rewrite this more compactly:

> *"If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$."*
