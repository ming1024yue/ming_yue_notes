### Definitions:

- **A perfect square** (or simply *square*) is an integer that is equal to some integer to the second power.  
  Some examples are:  
  $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100$

- **A perfect cube** (or simply *cube*) is an integer that is equal to some integer to the third power.  
  Some examples are:  
  $0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512$

$$
\begin{aligned}
0^3 &= 0 \quad &3^3 &= 27 \quad &6^3 &= 216 \\
1^3 &= 1 \quad &4^3 &= 64 \quad &7^3 &= 343 \\
2^3 &= 8 \quad &5^3 &= 125 \quad &8^3 &= 512 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

- **A perfect power** is an integer that is equal to some integer to a power that is at least 2.  
  Perfect squares and perfect cubes are examples of perfect powers.  
  Some others are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2^5 &= 32 \\
3^4 &= 81 \\
6^4 &= 1296 \\
5^6 &= 15625 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
**Definition:**  
We say that an integer $m$ is **divisible** by an integer $n$ when the quotient $\dfrac{m}{n}$ is an integer.

Otherwise, we say that $m$ is *not divisible* by $n$.

**Divisor**
When we say, “12 is a multiple of 3,” we mean that there is an integer that we can multiply by 3 that results in a product of 12.  Since 12 is divisible by 3, we call 3 a **divisor** of 12.

> *"If $b$ is divisible by $a$ and $c$ is divisible by $b$, then $c$ is divisible by $a$."*

We rewrite this more compactly:

> *"If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$."*


**Definition:**  
A **prime number** (or simply *prime*) is a natural number $p > 1$ whose only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$.

Follow the instructions and the grid above will reveal information about the integers:

1. Circle the number 2.  
2. Cross out all of the multiples of 2 that are greater than 2.  
3. Circle the smallest number that is neither circled nor crossed out.  
4. Cross out all of the multiples of the integer you circled in step 3 that have not already been crossed out.  
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all of the numbers on the grid are either circled or crossed out.

**What have we determined about each integer in the grid?**
