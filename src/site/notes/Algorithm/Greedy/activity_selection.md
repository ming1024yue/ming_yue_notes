## Explanation
The Activity Selection problem is a classic greedy algorithm problem that involves selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

### How it works:
1. Sort activities by finish time
2. Select first activity
3. For each remaining activity:
   - If it doesn't overlap with last selected activity, select it
   - Otherwise, skip it

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity: O(n)

### Applications:
- Scheduling problems
- Resource allocation
- Time management
- Project planning
- Task scheduling

### Advantages:
- Optimal solution
- Simple implementation
- Efficient for large inputs
- Works for many variations
- Easy to understand

### Disadvantages:
- Requires sorting
- Not suitable for all problems
- May need modifications
- Limited to specific cases
- Requires careful analysis
