## Explanation
Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

### How it works:
1. Initialize distances to infinity
2. Set distance to start vertex to 0
3. Use priority queue to process vertices
4. For each vertex, update distances to neighbors
5. Repeat until all vertices are processed

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O((V + E) log V)
- Average Case: O((V + E) log V)
- Worst Case: O((V + E) log V)

### Space Complexity: O(V + E)

### Applications:
- Routing protocols
- Network analysis
- Traffic engineering
- Path planning
- Resource allocation

### Advantages:
- Efficient for sparse graphs
- Works for directed graphs
- Can handle positive weights
- Easy to implement
- Memory efficient

### Disadvantages:
- Doesn't work with negative weights
- Slower for dense graphs
- Not suitable for all problems
- May be memory intensive
- Requires priority queue
